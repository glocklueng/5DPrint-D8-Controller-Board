5DPrint D8 Controller
=====================
The 5DPrint D8 is an open source 3D printer controller, designed for controlling the [MakiBox A6](https://store.makibox.com/) and other RepRap type/small consumer grade 3D printers.

Inspired by the Printrboard Rev.B and its predecessors, the D8 was redesigned from the ground up in order to improve upon the overall functionality and also eliminate some of the shortcomings inherant to these previous designs.

Firmware
--------
The D8 runs on the [5DPrint Firmware](https://bitbucket.org/makible/5dprint-firmware), which is a fork of Sprinter.
